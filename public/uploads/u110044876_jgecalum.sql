Our college had not alumni association in its own campus for around 50 years! It is strange, surprising and fact! Now one centralized approach has been initiated. The purpose of campus based alumni association is to work from the campus, work for the campus and work with the campus.It is established to promote the welfare of JGEC and to establish a mutually beneficial relationship between the College and its alumni. The Associationthus creates a bridge between alumni and present generation students through a wealth of activities, continuing socio-economic initiatives and value added events.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	We have got one of our most prestigious certificates from our beloved JGEC, for which we feel honoured. So if we want to give back to our beloved Alma Mater, then it is essential to work with the campus. We all know, our students stayed hundred miles away from major metro city. We all know how they spent their life at campus. So, can we not give them some support for their budding? We have not got those opportunities during our college days, as during our times there was no centralized alumni approach at our campus. That is the reason that we are trying to build our alumni association stronger. The alumni association is a platform where ex-students try to support present generation students with value based initiatives, by creating opportunities for growth and learning. We are here to share our experiences to our beloved present generation students so that they become ready to create opportunities and sustain in competitive market. We are here for giving back to our campus by creating brand for our college and by helping our present generation students.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	In last few years, Alumni Association has taken various initiatives campus among which technology innovation challenge, scholarships, cricket tournament, regular workshops and seminars are notable.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	The most challenging decision that Alumni Association has taken is to build state of the art Convention Centre, Kanchenjunga at our beloved campus. The Project Kanchenjunga is growing by leaps and bounds and we expect its ground floor to be declared open at the earliest. To taste the charm of stepping into our beloved Kanchenjunga in its operation we need a steady supply of fund as we are still far behind our targeted estimated value of the Project. I think this may be the right time to show gratitude for our Alma Mater and I appeal to my fellow alumnus to come forward and contribute for the Project Kanchanjunga.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	Also, I would like to request all of you to stay connected with Alumni Association and our beloved JGEC campus.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	Best Regards,</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">Dilip Kumar Roy</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; color: rgb(58, 59, 60); font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: rgb(236, 241, 245);\">\r\n	<span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: 700;\">Jalpaiguri Government Engineering College 1984 Batch</span></p>');
